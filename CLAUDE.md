## Project Goals
- Building a Lovable clone that uses the Claude Code API for code generation
- Focus: Simple TypeScript function that takes a prompt and generates code using Claude Code SDK
- Prove core functionality before expanding to full website generation

## Current Project Status

### Files Created
- `package.json` - Node.js project with TypeScript and Claude Code SDK dependency
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration 
- `.env` - Environment file with Anthropic API key
- `verify-key.js` - API key validation script
- `src/generator.ts` - Main function using Claude Code SDK with separate folder generation
- `test-tic-tac-toe.ts` - Test function moved to separate file (updated to test chess board)
- `test-css-js.ts` - Additional test script
- `output/index.html` - Generated tic-tac-toe game HTML
- `output/styles.css` - Generated modern CSS with animations
- `output/script.js` - Generated JavaScript with full game logic
- `output/2025-08-04T13-10-12-create-a-simple-tictactoe-game/` - First separate project folder
- `output/2025-08-04T13-16-55-create-a-simple-chess-board-wi/` - Second project folder (chess generation timed out)

### Progress Made
- ✅ Basic project setup completed
- ✅ Claude Code SDK dependency added (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- ✅ API key validation implemented and tested
- ✅ TypeScript configuration ready
- ✅ Core `generateWithClaude()` function implemented and working
- ✅ Claude Code SDK integration successfully tested
- ✅ Complete tic-tac-toe game generated as proof of concept
- ✅ Separate project folder functionality implemented
- ✅ Test function moved to separate file for better organization
- ✅ Generated games successfully run in Brave browser
- ✅ Multiple project generation tested (tic-tac-toe, chess attempt)

### Current Findings
- ✅ API key is valid and working with sufficient credits
- ✅ Anthropic API access confirmed (tested with claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)
- ✅ Project structure ready for main function implementation
- ✅ Claude Code SDK integration fully functional
- ✅ Separate folder generation working (format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-project-name`)
- ⚠️ Complex projects (like chess) may timeout - need longer timeout for advanced games
- ✅ Simple projects (tic-tac-toe) generate quickly and successfully
- ✅ Permission system working (acceptEdits mode configured)
- ✅ Browser integration tested and working

### Next Steps
1. ~~Add credits to Anthropic account~~ ✅ COMPLETED
2. ~~Implement the main `generateProject()` function using Claude Code SDK~~ ✅ COMPLETED
3. ~~Test the function with simple prompts~~ ✅ COMPLETED
4. ~~Handle Claude Code SDK permissions for automatic file creation~~ ✅ COMPLETED
5. ~~Create separate project folders for each generation~~ ✅ COMPLETED
6. Adjust timeout settings for complex project generation
7. Build web interface around the core functionality
8. Add project management features (list, delete, export projects)
9. Implement real-time streaming UI for generation progress
10. Add error handling and retry mechanisms

### Implemented Function
```typescript
async function generateWithClaude(prompt: string): Promise<GenerationResult> {
  // ✅ IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING
  // Uses Claude Code SDK to generate complete projects from natural language prompts
  // Handles streaming responses and file operations
  // Returns structured project information with success/error status
}
```

### Test Results
- **Function Status**: ✅ Working and tested
- **Test Case**: Generated complete tic-tac-toe game from natural language prompt
- **Output Quality**: Modern, clean, functional code with animations
- **SDK Integration**: Successfully connects and streams responses
- **Permission Handling**: Claude Code requests permission before file operations (security feature)

### Key Learnings
1. Claude Code SDK works exactly as expected for code generation
2. Permission system prevents unauthorized file writes (good security)
3. Streaming responses provide real-time feedback during generation
4. Generated code quality is high - modern, well-structured, and functional
5. Separate project folders enable multiple concurrent projects
6. Simple projects (games, utilities) generate quickly and reliably
7. Complex projects (chess, advanced apps) may need longer timeouts
8. Browser integration works seamlessly for testing generated projects
9. SDK handles different project types effectively
10. Ready to build full Lovable clone interface around this core functionality

### Technical Details
- **Project Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-project-name` format
- **Working Directory**: Each project gets isolated folder under `output/`
- **Permission Mode**: `acceptEdits` for automatic file operations
- **Timeout Handling**: 2-minute default, may need adjustment for complex projects
- **SDK Model**: Uses `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- **File Types**: Generates HTML, CSS, JavaScript with modern practices
- **Browser Testing**: Direct file opening works for static projects
